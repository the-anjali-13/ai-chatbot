<h3>AI-Chatbot</h3><br>
<p>I built a simple chatbot using JavaScript and Googleâ€™s Gemini API to get quick AI-generated responses. The idea was to make something that feels interactive and responds in real-time. It takes user input, sends it to the Gemini API, and displays the response in a chat-like format. The goal was to explore AI integration in web apps while keeping it lightweight and easy to use</p>
